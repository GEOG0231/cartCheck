Reference features Do you show features and place names that help people understand the location of something based on the location of one or more other things (i.e. allocentric referencing)? Do your reference features fit your visual hierarchy? Are they legible but not noisy? Map scale and extent Did you consider how the size of your region of interest, the amount of paper or monitor screen you have to work with, and your purpose for selecting and styling map elements influence your choice of scale? Did you make the scale (or representational fraction) a round number and something that easliy scales for measurement or reasoning about distance?

Did you develop the illusion of depth on your map? Do the most important features appear in the foreground? Have you made reference features, like roads, administrative boundaries, labels for major regions or locations, and graticule lines sit back in your visual hierarchy, so that they aren\u2019t the first things that people notice about your map but are nonetheless clearly legible? When you stand at a distance from the map and squint your eyes, are the things that appear darkest or heaviest on your map the most important elements on your map? Vertical hierarchy People may perceive things that are high on the layout as more important than things that are low. In western cultures, people tend to scan clockwise, beginning somewhere on the left, often top left. Did you place titles or arrange important features in these privileged positions? Did you put less important items (like credits and data sources) in the lower corners? Visual center The visual center of your map is a little higher than dead center. Did you try to arrange your layout so that you place an important feature there. Please note that this is likely most important for maps that people will see all at once, like printed maps in books or posters or digital maps that are first seen at full extent. Printed ribbon maps and digital scrolly maps generally do not have a visual center. Grid What is your scheme for arranging elements on the page. Did you employ a grid, the golden ratio, or another scheme? Did you use something to align elements on your layout without using neat-lines, hard frames, and other distracting bounding lines? If you incarcerated your data in these lines, do these visual prisons fit your intended style?","title":"Layout"},{"location":"lettering/","text":"Legibility Are all of your labels and symbols on the map legible? Did you check how type, lines, points, and icons interact with elements and colors of your background? You may have to change the color of the label in some locations to improve contrast. You may also need to avoid particularly slender or \u201clight\u201d fonts if you are printing on a white background. Graphic association Have you helped the reader associate symbols and labels by associating their visual variables? For example, did use the same hue or weight to associate line and label? To test this, squint at a label paired with a symbol. They should appear to have the same visual weight. Spatial association Does the placement of a label resemble the spatial characteristic of the referent? Are rivers and water features italicized to resemble their movement? Do mountain ranges range? Are cities aligned with a graticule? Are coastal towns on the water? Minimal disturbance Have you positioned your labels so that they don\u2019t disturb other map elements? Have you avoided the oBERLIN and ROMEo problems of text and symbol alignment? Have you avoided clutter when text overlaps line symbols by knocking out the underlying lines. Type taxonomy Did you devise a taxonomy for your labels that helps someone distinguish and associate the different things that appear on the map? First, make a list of the kinds of things that appear on your map. Then use a different type style to distinguish each kind of thing. Use hue, size, capitalization, bold/italic and fonts to develop your type taxonomy. Ant party Do your labels appear cluttered in an area? Did you save the darkest inks for only the most important labels, or the labels you want to have the highest contrast and most legibility?","title":"Lettering"},{"location":"marginalia/","text":"Marginalia provide additional information to promote understanding and reduce confusion in map reading. What is your point? Does your title quickly cue the reader to the map\u2019s purpose of theme? Try to avoid writing titles that simply describe the location of your map. Try to write a title that helps people see the meaning of your mapped geography and not just the location of it. Example: Bill Bunge (1968) What are your instructions? What would you like someone to know about your map? What directions should you provide to help your audience read and understand your map? Imagine that you are standing next to your map and you have 15 seconds to talk to the reader before they start looking at your map. Put this information on the map in a place where people will likely see it early. Do this by placement (upper-left is a good place) rather than visual weight. A good map introduction is not that different than a good written introduction. You want to help the reader understand at least three things: What is this map about? Why is this important or why should a reader care? How are you showing them this? (This could include a quick description of dataset, a quick description of how to read or interact with map, or a quick description of your design aesthetic.) Some cartographers also like to tell the reader what the map shows . Other cartographers simply want the introduction to encourage the reader to spend time with the map and come up with their own interpretations. Which way is north? Will the map reader be able to orient the map? If your map follows the \u2018north up\u2019 convention of most maps, then you may not need to include a north arrow. However, if north is not up, or if you are showing a geography that may not be familiar to your audience, or if you include reference features that may be confusing (such as the coastline along Santa Barbara, CA where the Pacific Ocean lies to the south of the mainland), then adding a north arrow will likely help the reader orient and reduce confusion. Reference scale Is it important for your audience to understand your map\u2019s scale? Do they need to reason about distances? If so, did you include a scale bar or did you label distances directly onto connecting features like roads or did you provide some other means for directly representing the map\u2019s scale? When choosing increments, did you use round numbers with intervals that reflect how people think about distances? Where in the world Will your reader know the geographic context of the map? If not, will the reader benefit from knowing this, or can your map function without this geographic context? If you are making a tourist map for tourists who are already at your site, then you probably do not need to include a locator map. But if your audience is not already present in your map, then they may need some help understanding how your map fits the world as they know it. Sign dictionary Have you considered which features should be included in a legend or map key and which features you can leave off? In general, reference features often do NOT need to be included in a legend. There are two reasons for this: They should be styled with iconic principles (e.g. blue for water). They will often be labeled (placenames). So the iconic styles and associated place names together function like a legend (helping to define the features directly on the mapped geography). In general, thematic features should be defined in a legend or map key. Their inclusion helps echo their significance. (Look how important these things are! They got listed in a special place on the map!) There are a couple of conventions for legend design: Arrange like a dictionary: symbol on left, definition on right. Arrange logical groups: you can do this either by geometry (area features, line features, point features shown in groups) or by theme (water features, transportation features, administrative features, etc). Example: NPS map of Acadia National Park Sources Did you list the sources of your data? You should include enough information to help someone find the datasets that you use or know the source material for data that you created. This information should be low in your visual hierarchy: there if people want to find it, but not emphasized. Credits Did you list yourself as the author/cartographer of the map? This information is often placed in the same location and with the same visual emphasis as the sources.","title":"Marginalia"},{"location":"object/","text":"What is the purpose of your map? What do you want to help someone learn about the world with your map? Are you helping someone navigate space? Or plan a trip? Or learn things about people who inhabit the place, now or in the past?
